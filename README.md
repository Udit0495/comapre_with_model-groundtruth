# Compare_with_Model-Groundtruth

This project, **Compare_with_Model-Groundtruth**, is a Python-based utility for evaluating machine learning model performance by comparing model predictions with ground truth annotations. It is designed for tasks such as object detection, classification, or other predictive modeling tasks, offering tools to compute performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Overview
The **Compare_with_Model-Groundtruth** project facilitates the evaluation of machine learning models by comparing their predictions against ground truth data. It is particularly useful for assessing model performance in tasks like object detection or classification, where quantitative metrics and visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices) are essential for understanding model accuracy and areas for improvement. The project is built with Python and leverages popular libraries for data processing and evaluation.

## Features
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Flexible Input Formats**: Supports comparison of predictions and ground truth in formats like CSV or JSON.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows adjustment of confidence thresholds for evaluation to fine-tune metric calculations.
- **Visualization**: Generates visual outputs, such as confusion matrices, to aid in performance analysis.
- **Modular Design**: Provides reusable scripts for integration into larger machine learning pipelines.

## Prerequisites
To use this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python >= 3.8
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
- A dataset containing model predictions and corresponding ground truth annotations in a compatible format (e.g., CSV or JSON).

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Udit0495/compare_with_model-groundtruth.git
   cd compare_with_model-groundtruth
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Preparation
Prepare your dataset with model predictions and ground truth data in a compatible format:
1. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── predictions/
   │   ├── pred_file1.csv
   │   ├── pred_file2.csv
   │   └── ...
   ├── groundtruth/
   │   ├── gt_file1.csv
   │   ├── gt_file2.csv
   │   └── ...
   ```
   - `predictions/`: Contains model prediction files (e.g., `.csv` files with columns like `image_id`, `class_id`, `confidence`).
   - `groundtruth/`: Contains ground truth files (e.g., `.csv` files with columns like `image_id`, `class_id`).
   - Ensure prediction and ground truth files are paired by filename or a mapping file.

2. **File Format**:
   - **Predictions**: Each file should include model outputs, such as predicted class labels and confidence scores. Example CSV format:
     ```
     image_id,class_id,confidence
     image1.jpg,0,0.95
     image1.jpg,1,0.85
     ```
   - **Ground Truth**: Each file should include true labels. Example CSV format:
     ```
     image_id,class_id
     image1.jpg,0
     image1.jpg,1
     ```

3. **Update Configuration**:
   Modify the configuration in the main script (e.g., `compare.py`) to specify paths to the `predictions/` and `groundtruth/` directories and adjust evaluation parameters like confidence thresholds.

## Usage
1. **Run the Comparison Script**:
   Execute the main script to compare predictions with ground truth data and compute metrics:
   ```bash
   python compare.py
   ```
   - Update `compare.py` to point to your `predictions/` and `groundtruth/` directories.
   - Adjust thresholds (e.g., `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`) for evaluation.

2. **Output**:
   - **Metrics**: Outputs performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to the console or a file.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Generates a visual or tabular confusion matrix, saved to the `results/` directory.
   - Results are stored in the `results/` directory (e.g., as CSV files or plots).
